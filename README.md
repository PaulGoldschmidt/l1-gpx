# Transalpine Track from Garmisch-Patenkirchen to Brescia (L1)
These are the GPX files for the transalpine crossing along the path of the L1.
The L1 Alpine Crossing is a challenging hiking route that traverses a section of the European Alps. This trail offers breathtaking views of snow-capped peaks, pristine mountain lakes, and lush alpine meadows. Hikers on the L1 route experience diverse terrains, from rocky paths to gentle slopes, as they make their way through multiple countries. The crossing typically takes several days to complete, with hikers often staying in mountain huts or refuges along the way. While demanding, the L1 Alpine Crossing rewards trekkers with unforgettable panoramas and a sense of accomplishment upon completion - these are the GPX Tracks that are embedded in Paul Goldschmidt's report on the hike in his German [Blog](https://p3g3.de/transalpin-wandern-l1).
